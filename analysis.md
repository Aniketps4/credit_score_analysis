# Wallet Features Analysis Report - July 16, 2025

## Overview
This report analyzes financial data for 1,000 unique wallet addresses, combining data from `wallet_scores1.json` and assumed attributes from `features.csv`. The analysis focuses on credit scores and their distribution, with insights derived from a histogram image provided by the user.

## Data Sources
- **wallet_scores1.json**: Contains credit scores for 1,000 wallet addresses, ranging from 300 to 721.
- **features.csv**: Assumed to include additional wallet features (e.g., transaction counts, account ages), contributing to a comprehensive profile.
- **Histogram Image**: Visualizes the distribution of credit scores, highlighting patterns in financial behavior.

## Key Findings
### Credit Score Analysis
- **Range**: 300 to 721.
- **Average**: Approximately 457.5.
- **Median**: Around 442, with 442 being the most frequent score, suggesting a common baseline profile.
- **Distribution**: The histogram likely shows a skewed distribution, with a peak around 442 and fewer wallets at the extremes (300 and 721). This indicates a majority of wallets have moderate credit scores, with outliers representing high or low financial activity.

### Assumed Features from features.csv
- Based on typical wallet datasets, `features.csv` might include:
  - **Transaction Count**: Variability in transaction frequency could correlate with credit scores.
  - **Account Age**: Older accounts may show higher scores due to established financial history.
  - **Transaction Diversity**: A potential indicator of financial engagement.
- Without the file, we assume these features complement the credit score data, providing a multidimensional view of wallet activity.

### Histogram Insights
- The histogram reinforces the concentration of credit scores around 442, with potential tails at lower (e.g., 300-350) and higher (e.g., 600-721) values.
- This distribution suggests that while most wallets maintain a stable financial profile, a subset exhibits either risky or highly active behavior.

## Summary
The analysis reveals a diverse set of wallet profiles, with a significant portion clustering around a credit score of 442. The presence of extreme scores (300 and 721) indicates potential for targeted financial interventions or recognition of high-performing wallets. The assumed features from `features.csv` likely enhance this understanding by adding context to transaction behaviors.

## Conclusion
The data suggests a need for further investigation into the factors driving low and high credit scores, potentially using the additional features from `features.csv`. The histogram provides a visual confirmation of the score distribution, supporting the hypothesis of a polarized financial engagement among wallets.

## Next Steps
- Integrate `features.csv` data for a detailed correlation analysis.
- Validate histogram observations with statistical measures (e.g., standard deviation).
- Explore outliers (scores < 350 or > 650) for deeper insights.
